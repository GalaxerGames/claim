# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
# Deployment : 
Deploy 
Galaxer.sol
CosmicCrucible.sol
On deployment :
Set Galaxer contract address
Set penalty address
Set staker role
Portal.sol
On deployment

In this order
Then 
Set Portal address as Staker_Role in CosmicCrucible.sol
And Set Portal address as MINTER_ROLE in Galaxer.sol
